1. Debian-based distros

   1. Launchpad PPA names are read from files in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`. Names are saved to file `<basepath>/repos/launchpad-ppas.list`.  This file can be edited to comment-out or remove lines for unwanted repos.
   2. Third party PPAs are determined by reading list files in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`. Source lines are saved to file `<basepath>/repos/<repo-name>.list`.  Files can be deleted from the backup folder for unwanted repos.
   3. Apt keys are exported to file `<basepath>/repos/apt.keys`

2. Fedora-based distros - Not supported

3. Arch-based distros

   * Packages that are part of the Linux distribution base.
      * Debian-based - Determined by reading `/var/log/installer/initial-status.gz` and will be filtered out. Cannot be determined if this file is missing on the system.
      * Other distros - Cannot be determined and will not be filtered out

3. List of filtered packages are saved to `<basepath>/packages/selected.list`. This file can be edited to comment-out or remove lines for unwanted packages.

#### Restore

Usage: `aptik --restore-packages`

Group's line in both files are saved as `<groupname>.group` and `<groupname>.gshadow` in the backup folder. You can delete the files for any groups that you do not wish to restore.
2. For all groups, the list of users in the group are saved in file `<basepath>/groups/memberships.list`.

#### Restore

Following actions are executed for restore:

1. *Missing groups* are added from backup folder `<basepath>/groups`
   1. Missing users are added using `groupadd` command

   3. Group's password, admin and member fields are updated in `/etc/gshadow`
2. *Missing members* are added to groups
   1. Missing members are added to groups by reading the file `<basepath>/groups/memberships.list`. Members are added directly by updating `/etc/group`

### Home Data

#### Backup

Usage: `aptik --backup-home`

Following actions are executed for backup:

1. For each user, the contents of home directory are archived using TAR + GZIP and saved to file  `<basepath>/home/<username>/data.tar.gz`. Full backup is created every time a backup is taken.

2. When creating backups using **duplicity** (option `--duplicity`), data is saved to folder `<basepath>/home/<username>`. 

   - Incremental backups are created if an existing backup is found. Full backups are created if there is no existing backup, or if full backup was specified by user (option `--full`).
   - Backups are encrypted with specified password (option `--password <string>`). A default password `aptik` is used if none is specified.

3. Backups can be created for specific users with option `--users <user1,user2...>`. Specify a comma-separated list of user names without space.

4. Some directories are excluded by default to save space and avoid issues after restore.

   ```
   ~/.thumbnails
   ~/.cache
   ~/.dbus
   ~/.gvfs
   ~/.config/dconf/user
   ~/.local/share/Trash
   ~/.local/share/trash
   ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/Cache
   ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/OfflineCache
   ~/.opera/cache
   ~/.kde/share/apps/kio_http/cache
   ~/.kde/share/cache/http
   ```

5. Hidden files and folders in home directories can be excluded with option `--exclude-hidden` . These files and folders contain *user-specific application and system settings*. These can be excluded if you wish to only migrate your data, without migrating your application settings.

#### Restore

Usage: `aptik --restore-home`

Following actions are executed for restore:

1. For each user, the TAR file backup `<basepath>/home/<username>/data.tar.gz` is extracted to the user's home directory. Files are restored to original locations along with original permissions and timestamps.
2. For each user, the ownership is updated for file and folders in user's home directory. This ensures that all files in home directory are owned by the user.
3. When restoring a duplicity backup, the steps are similar. Data is restored from backup files created by duplicity in `<basepath>/home/<username>`.
   {0}. The password should be specified during restore if it was specified during backup (option `--password <string>`). A default password `aptik` is used if none is specified.
4. Backups can be restored for specific users with option `--users <user1,user2...>`. Specify a comma-separated list of user names without space.

### DConf Settings

The dconf database stores application settings for the user. Aptik can backup and restore any changes that were made to default settings by the user.

#### Backup

Usage: `aptik --backup-dconf`

Following actions are executed for backup:

1. For each user, dconf settings that are different from defaults are dumped to backup file `<basepath>/dconf/<username>/dconf.settings`

#### Restore

Usage: `aptik --restore-dconf`

Following actions are executed for restore:

1. For each user, dconf settings are imported from backup file `<basepath>/dconf/<username>/dconf.settings`

### Mount Entries

#### Backup

Usage: `aptik --backup-mounts`

Following actions are executed for backup:

1. Entries in `/etc/fstab` and `/etc/crypttab` are saved to backup folder  `<basepath>/mounts` . Entries are saved individually as `<dev-name>_<mount-point>.fstab` and `<dev-name>_<mount-point>.crypttab` in the backup folder. You can delete the files for any mount entries that you do not wish to restore.
     *  Device names like `/dev/sda1` and `/dev/mapper/sd2_crypt` will be replaced by UUIDs like `UUID=576be21b-3c3a-4287-b971-40b8e8b39823` while saving backup files. This makes the entries portable so that they can be used on other systems where the device names may be different.

#### Restore

Usage: `aptik --restore-mounts`

Following actions are executed for restore:

1. Backups are created for  `/etc/fstab` and `/etc/crypttab` by moving existing files to  `/etc/fstab.bkup.<timestamp>` and `/etc/crypttab.bkup.<timestamp>`
2. Extra entries in the backup folder are added to `/etc/fstab` and `/etc/crypttab` . Existing entries in `/etc/fstab` and `/etc/crypttab` will be preserved. Extra entries are determined by checking if the mount point is used by an existing entry.
   * All entries are sorted on the mount point field. This ensures that base mount points are mounted before mounting subdirectories.
   * Backup entry for `/boot/efi` will not be added, if not already existing in `/etc/fstab`
   * It is recommended to review changes after restore completes. Run `sudo aptik --list-mounts` or `cat /etc/fstab; cat /etc/crypttab;` to view the updated entries.
