## Aptik Migration Utility

Aptik is a tool for **migrating settings and data** from one Linux installation to another. It can be used while re-installing the operating system and when moving to the next release of a Linux distribution.

Aptik is **NOT a data backup tool** and should not be used as such. It is only meant to migrate data and settings from one Linux installation to another. There are no features which enable Aptik to be used as a backup tool, and this is by design. There are no options for scheduling backups, data encryption, etc. For security you can use an encrypted USB drive as the backup location and delete the data once you finish migrating to the new Linux installation.

For best results, Aptik should be run on a **fresh Linux installation**. It can be safely run on an existing system but the results will not be same as the system from which backups were created.

Aptik supports **Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch and their derivatives**. Some features may be available only on some distributions. For example, migrating downloaded packages from package manager cache is supported only on Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives (which use apt); and on Arch and derivatives (which use pacman).

Aptik should only be used to migrate between two installations of **same distribution**. For example, you can migrate from Fedora 24 to Fedora 25, or from Ubuntu 17.04 to Ubuntu 17.10, but not from Fedora to Ubuntu. This is because package names and respositories vary between different distributions and cannot be safely migrated. You can migrate some items such as fonts, icons, themes, etc but you need to be careful and check for issues after you do the restore.

Aptik should only be used to migrate between two installations of **same architecture**. For example, you can migrate from 32-bit to 32-bit system, or from 64-bit to 64-bit system, but not from 32-bit to 64-bit. This is because package names and respositories vary between different architecures and cannot be safely migrated.

## **Features**

- **Migrate Software Packages** - Aptik saves a list of installed software packages to the selected backup location. The packages will be re-installed on the new system on restore. Supports Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch and derivatives. On Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives the list of packages that are saved include only those software that was installed by the user. The list does not include packages that came with the distribution or that were installed to satisfy dependencies. This makes it easy to review and edit the list of packages.
- **Migrate Software Repositories** - Saves a list of extra software repositories added to the system. The repos will be added to the new system on restore. Supports Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives. On Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives, both Launchpad PPAs and custom repositories (Google Chrome, Oracle VirtualBox, etc) are supported. Missing GPG keys for repositories will be imported on restore.
- **MIgrate Package Manager Cache** - Saves downloaded packages from system cache to the selected backup location. Copies packages to system cache of the new system on restore. This saves time in downloading packages while re-installing software. Supports Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives (which use apt); and Arch and derivatives (which use pacman).
- **MIgrate Fonts, Icons, Themes** - Saves fonts, icons, and themes to the selected backup location. Copies items to the new system on restore. Supports Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch and derivatives.
- **Migrate User Accounts, Groups and Group Memberships** - Saves a list of users, groups and group memberships to the selected backup location. Re-creates missing users, groups and group memberships on the new system on restore. Users accounts are migrated along with encrypted account passwords and account settings (such home directory path, password expiry rules, etc). Supports Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch and derivatives.
- **Migrate Home Directory Data** - Saves data from user home directories to selected backup location using duplicity. Data is compressed before saving. Supports Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch and derivatives.
- **Migrate Device Mount Settings** - Saves and restores device mount settings in /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab. Supports Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch and derivatives.
- **Migrate Cron Tasks** - Saves and restores cron jobs for each user. Supports Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch and derivatives.
- **Command-line Tool** - A command-line tool is available for people who prefer to work from a terminal. Aptik GTK is simply a GUI wrapper around the command-line tool.
- **Dry Run Mode** - The command-line tool has a ``--dry-run`` switch which can be used to view actions that will be executed on restore without making changes to the system.
- **Donation Feature** - A complimentary feature is available for users who donate or contrbute to this project. An option will be enabled to generate a single-file, stand-alone installer which can be executed on the new system for restoring the backups. This installer can be used as a "transformation pack" which when executed on a new Linux installation, will transform it to the original system.
